Tree Traversal

1. Preorder
2. InOrder
3. PostOrder
4. DFS
5. BFS

Tree Property
1. Height of the Tree
2. Max Node in the Tree
3. InOrder Predessor
4. InOrder Successor

Tree Operations
1. Top View of the tree
2. Bottom view of the tree
3. PreOrder Traversal given find is it valid
4. Given Tree is Binary Search Tree (Inorder traversal is sorted or not)
5. Print all paths from root to leaf


AppOrbit:
Reverse Inorder Traversal
kth smallest element and kth largest in binary search tree
